# PFSenseScripts
Random scripts to ease admistration of PfSense

Trying to ease the window/terminal hopping and back and forth associated with adding a peer to wireguard on PfSense,
but this can really be used for any wireguard installation.

Hopefully the pfsense devs build something like this right into the interface, building a client config on the fly and storing it safely for each peer,
then offering it in both the .conf file format and the QR code format.

A great additional step would be some method to deliver it to the client in a secure fashion.
